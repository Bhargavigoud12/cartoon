# cartoon

Cartoonizer is a Python application that applies a cartoon effect to images using OpenCV. It utilizes techniques such as bilateral filtering and adaptive thresholding to transform photos into cartoon-style images. This project is a fun way to experiment with image processing and explore computer vision techniques.

## Features
- Upload an image file to apply the cartoon effect.
- Resize images to a standard resolution for processing.
- Save the cartoonized image in JPEG format.
- Display the resulting cartoon image.
